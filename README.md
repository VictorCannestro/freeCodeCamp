# freeCodeCamp Projects
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) is an online education nonprofit for self-paced learning in Python and JavaScript and, like its name suggests, it is 100% free. My [profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/vccannes) is publicly available to view, however, solutions to the projects aren't visible and can only be viewed on this GitHub repository. Feel free to take inspiration from them, however, note that there is a anit-plagerism pledge students must take as part of the Academic Honesty Policy on the website.
